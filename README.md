A group project I worked on through university with two of my classmates.

We used Python to create a turn-based, pure-text, RPG. Through the use of a Object-Oriented-Programming style, every character, item, enemy, and the map itself was created through importing the relevant object from a JSON file, making it easy to add new things to the game by way of simple text-editing.
